A repository for my current/working projects

Hi, I’m Adele Menezes, a Computer Science and Environmental Science & Policy student at Florida State University. My academic and professional experiences have allowed me to develop skills in C#, Python, SQL, MATLAB, PowerShell, and GIS. I’m passionate about full-stack development, automation, and environmental data analysis.

Currently, I’m:
- Learning C# and .NET for full-stack development.
- Expanding my SQL and database management skills.
- Exploring Python for data analysis and automation.
